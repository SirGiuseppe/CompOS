{"name":"CompOS","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to the CompOS Project\r\nThe CompOS project is the journey to create an excellent DE made by everyone, for everyone.\r\nThis includes support for apps by other vendors, skinning, and (yes) custom distributions\r\n(if you wanna make it sound lame, it is basically Linux on Windows)\r\nBut, if it was truly Linux on Windows, we wouldn't need this page. The showstopper(s!) of the project follows:\r\n\r\n### The first in the industry.\r\nCompOS is the first VBDE to be publicly maintained and developed. That means that people from all skill levels can come along and help.\r\n\r\n### Don't code in VB.NET? No problem!\r\nThis is for all coding languages, just grab yourself a clone of the git repo and get coding!\r\n\r\n### New release every week!\r\nWe hand-pick a release version every week. That means you get a whole new set of features to test every week, bugs and all! We try to pick the most stable releases and test them before packaging them in a fancy installer and releasing them officially.\r\n\r\n### Multiple app vendors: Unlike other VB.NET-based DE's, we aim to create an open market with user-created apps, as well as other apps by vendors like you guys.\r\n\r\n### [And of course!] Flavoring: Create customizable skins to suit what you want out of your PC.\r\n\r\n### So come on down and get coding!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
